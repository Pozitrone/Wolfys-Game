1. Creating a world
    In order to create a world, one must hit the "Create World" button in the left menu and then type the world name and seed (optional) into the input field at the bottom.
    Then click Run.

2. Controls
    - Just as in almost all the games, the buttons for **movement** are **W S A** and **D**.
    - In order to **collect herbs**, press **Space Bar** when on the herb tile.
    - To shoot a **fireball** in the direction you are looking, press **F**.

3. Inventory
    The inventory contains all the herbs you collect. Hovering over one will tell you it's effects. Clicking on the herb will consume it.

4. Map
    The map button brings out a biome map of the world (It's procedurally generated, so... not the whole world, just a part of it.)

5. Statistics
    Contains some basic information about your world.

6. Quests
    Opens up a window with a difficulty selection. depending on the difficulty you choose, a quest will be accepted.
    Once you finish the quest (eg. collect all the required herbs), you will receive experience points.

7. Saving and loading world
    You can also save your world. By clicking the "Save World" button, you are given a large string of characters, which you can save somewhere in a .txt file.
    To load the world, simply click "Load World" and paste your string into the input (and hit Run).
