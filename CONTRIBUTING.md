# Code
As this game is mainly used as a "show off" of my skills, I do not look for any code contribution, except hints and ideas and tips. You can submit these in the comments for each issue, or make an issue of your own.

# Pixelart
All pixelart is to be submitted to their respective issue as a comment containing the art in dimensions 24*24. (these dims might change)
